# sneakyML
machine learning-based tool designed to predict potential network security threats and assess risk levels based on real-time network characteristics. It utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict attack types and a Random Forest Regressor to estimate the vulnerability risk level.

MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAMS

install nmap
pip install pandas numpy joblib scikit-learn xgboost nmap

Run the vulnerability.py first and then run scanner.py
